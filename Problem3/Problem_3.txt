Average age of survivors: 28.343689655172415
Average age of non-survivors: 30.62617924528302

Hypothesis: “The average age of passengers who survived the sinking of the Titanic is not very different 
from (i.e., neither much below nor much above) the average age of passengers who did not survive the sinking 
of the Titanic.”

Based on the results that we got, we can accept the Hypothesis.
